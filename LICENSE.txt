SOURCE CODE
A human comprehensible representation of software or hardware functionality that
can be used to perform a computational action. Additional steps may be
required to do so, such as compilation or combination with other SYSTEMS.

This not only includes typical "Software Languages" such as C, but also
configuration layouts that can be used to write fpga bitstreams or create
physical electronic circuits.

It includes representations that can be viewed or heard and are not text.

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

BINARY, BINARIES
A sequence of bytes that is not easily human comprehensible, but can be utilized
to perform some computational/logical action by software or hardware.

Examples:
* JVM byte code
* .NET CLR byte code
* x86 machine code
* Bitstream for a FPGA

Where BINARY is used it refers to such bytes that have been created using some
process from SOURCE CODE of THE SOFTWARE.

Such bytes may include data created from SOURCE CODE that is not part
of THE SOFTWARE.

Changes made to THE SOFTWARE, including alterations, enhancements, updates,
or other modifications.

This includes translation of THE SOFTWARE into SOURCE CODE of another type.

mechanism, regardless of in-between steps.

  * Pointer Calls
* Usage via any API ( Application Programming Interface )
* Usage via any RPC ( Remote Procedure Call ) method
* Invoking as a subprocess
* Any other form of software or hardware interaction that allows
  functionalities to be accessed, used, or modified.

Any copied, MODIFIED, redistributed, or PROVIDED SOFTWARE FORM must be
licensed under this same license.

When BINARIES are redistributed, RECIPIENT must:
* Provides notice and reference to THE SOFTWARE that is being licensed
* Inform those they are redistributing to that the BINARY remains under this
  license and may only be used, copied, or redistributed by following the
  license.
