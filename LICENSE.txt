SOURCE CODE
A human comprehensible representation of software or hardware functionality that
is useful in some way. Additional steps may be required to do so, such as
compilation or combination with a SYSTEM.

Examples:
  * "Software Languages" such as C
  * Configuration layouts for creation of fpga bitstreams or electronic circuits.
  * Documentation in any form ( TXT, DOC, PDF, etc )
_  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _ 

BINARY
Data that is not easily human comprehensible, but is useful in some way.

Examples: JVM bytecode, .NET CLR MSIL, x86 machine code, FPGA Bitstream
_  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _ 

MODIFICATION
Any change to THE SOFTWARE.

Includes translation of THE SOFTWARE into SOURCE CODE of another type.

Includes any process to produce new SOURCE CODE from THE SOFTWARE regardless
of in-between steps in any form including possible BINARY forms.

* Any form of software or hardware interaction that allows functionalities to
  be accessed, used, or modified.
