________________________________________________________________________________

Grant of Rights
---------------

You may use, copy, MODIFY, and redistribute THE SOURCE, provided you adhere to
the terms of this license.

You may use or redistribute MUTATIONS of THE SOFTWARE given you PROVIDE
SOURCE CODE and BUILD CODE of that MUTATION.

You may LINK THE SOFTWARE with SYSTEMS to create a combined work, and
use or redistribute that combined work, given that you PROVIDE SOURCE CODE of
the LINKED version of THE SOFTWARE.

You may LINK DERIVATIVES of THE SOFTWARE with SYSTEMS to create a combined
work, and use or redistribute that combined work, given that you BUILD CODE of
the LINKED or included DERIVATIVE or MUTATION of THE SOFTWARE.

The overall combined work, while utilizing THE SOFTWARE, need not as a whole be
licensed under this license.

________________________________________________________________________________

MODIFICATION Attribution
------------------------

If you MODIFY THE SOFTWARE, you must PROVIDE the following:
  * The copyright owner of the change ( legal name or legal entity name )
  * The date of the change

MODIFICATIONS to THE SOFTWARE must be PROVIDED, even if only used privately.

________________________________________________________________________________

No Anonymous CONTRIBUTORS
-------------------------

CONTRIBUTORS must provide their legal name or the official name of the entity
making the MODIFICATION. This information must accompany each MODIFICATION.

________________________________________________________________________________

Representation
--------------

CONTRIBUTORS agree that their contributions are their original creation or that
they have sufficient rights to grant the rights to their MODIFICATIONS conveyed
by this license.

________________________________________________________________________________

Termination
-----------

If you fail to comply with the terms of this license, your rights under this
license will terminate automatically without notice.

________________________________________________________________________________

Disclaimer of Warranty
----------------------

THE SOFTWARE is provided "as is," without warranty of any type.

THE SOFTWARE is not claimed to be free of defects or fit for any purpose.

All risk associated with using THE SOFTWARE is your own.

Should THE SOFTWARE prove defective, you are responsible.

________________________________________________________________________________

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

Unless required by law no OWNER, CONTRIBUTOR, or DISTRIBUTOR will be liable for
damages of any sort arising out of the use or inability to use THE SOFTWARE.

________________________________________________________________________________

Severability
------------
If any provision of this license, or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance, is held invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of
this license and the application of such provisions to other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected thereby and shall be enforced to the
greatest extent permitted by law. Each provision of this license shall be
valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

________________________________________________________________________________

Requirement to PROVIDE
----------------------

Where this license requires that CODE ( SOURCE CODE or BUILD CODE )
must be PROVIDED:

* CODE must be disclosed and accessible to the public in a manner that ensures
  reasonable discoverability.
* CODE must be made available online in a public fashion that allows download
  or sharing of that content for free without any registration or limitation
  of who accesses that content or why.
* The online distribution must be discoverable via navigation from the root
  of a domain via normal HTTP links within 10 navigations. One simple method
  to ensure this would be to have a site tree that is linked on the homepage
  and have source code be a point in that site tree.
  
Provision of the CODE on a public Github repo is sufficient to count
as a online location. It is reccomended but not required to link to that
Github from a domain or website associated with the company or person
utilizing THE SOFTWARE.

________________________________________________________________________________

Development Allowance
---------------------

CONTRIBUTORS of THE SOFTWARE are allowed a development period to refine and
test changes. The MODIFIED software must be PROVIDED only if and when it is
actually used for some purpose beyond development and testing.

Once MODIFIED versions of THE SOFTWARE are used such, the CONTRIBUTOR must
PROVIDE SOURCE CODE of the MODIFICATIONS within 90 days.

Where BUILD CODE is required to be PROVIDED, it also must be PROVIDED within
90 days.

________________________________________________________________________________


END REMOVABLE SECTION
________________________________________________________________________________

Prohibition on Circumvention
----------------------------

While LINKING of THE SOFTWARE with proprietary modules is permitted under
this license, LINKING that serves the purpose of reimplementing or substituting
features or functionality of the software in order to change it, without
providing these changes under this license, is expressly forbidden.

This clause is intended to prevent the use of LINKING as a method to circumvent
the requirement to disclose modifications or enhancements made to the
software. Any such attempt to reimplement features or functionalities of
THE SOFTWARE through LINKING, for the purpose of altering THE SOFTWARE's
behavior or functionality without releasing the resulting modifications under
this license, will be considered a breach of the license terms.

________________________________________________________________________________

Patent Grant
------------------------

If a patented method or technology is added to, implemented in, or used in
THE SOFTWARE, the CONTRIBUTOR must provide a patent grant. This grant must
explicitly allow users of THE SOFTWARE to use the patented method or technology
that is utilized in the software under the terms of this license without
additional charges or restrictions.

The patent grant must be provided in the form of a legally signed PDF document
by an individual authorized to grant the use of the patent. The document must
clearly identify the patent and the scope of the grant.

The signed patent grant PDF must be included in SOURCE CODE within a directory
named patents. This directory must be accessible to all users who have access
to the SOURCE CODE that is PROVIDED.

This requirement ensures that RECIPIENTS can use, modify, and redistribute
THE SOFTWARE freely without the risk of patent infringement claims. This
provision ensures that any enhancements made that involve patented
technology are shared openly, freely, and fairly with the community.

________________________________________________________________________________

Future License Revision Auto-Adoption
-------------------------------------

To ease refinement of this license, the default incarnation of this license
allows automatic migration of the license to revised terms:

This section, starting from "Future License Revision Auto-Adoption" until the
end of the file, may be removed by any CONTRIBUTOR who wishes to. If that is
done, the "+" from the end of the version number of the license at the top of
this file may and must be removed as well.

It is understood and allowed to relicense the code under the latest version of
the "Fair Coding License" as distributed by Dry Ark LLC, given the following
requirements for those future license revisions:

A. The revision remains true to the spirit of the original license.

B. The revision remains focused on preserving the freedom to use, modify, and
distribute THE SOFTWARE, while preventing private modifications.

C. The revision adds no cost requirements to utilizing THE SOFTWARE.

We encourage you to leave this requirement intact so that you don't get stuck
in a situation where you are unable to adopt new protections in revisions due
to a wide number of CONTRIBUTORS.

This is intended to foster a collaborative development environment and 
ensure that enhancements to THE SOFTWARE or uses of it that result in
derivative works, remain accessible and beneficial to the community.

CONTRIBUTORS are encouraged to engage constructively in efforts to refine and
improve the licensing terms to reflect advances in software development
practices and to close any loopholes that might allow circumvention of the
collaborative spirit of this license.
