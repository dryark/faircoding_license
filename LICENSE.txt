* SOURCE CODE of MODIFICATIONS to THE SOFTWARE

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

SOURCE CODE
A human comprehensible representation of software or hardware functionality that
can be used to perform a computational action. Additional steps may be
required to do so, such as compilation or combination with other SYSTEMS.

Examples:
* Typical "Software Languages" such as C
* Configuration layouts for creation of fpga bitstreams or electronic circuits.

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

BINARY, BINARIES
Data that is not easily human comprehensible, but can be utilized
to perform some computational/logical action by software or hardware.

Examples: JVM bytecode, .NET CLR MSIL, x86 machine code, FPGA Bitstream

Where BINARY is used it refers to data created using some process from
SOURCE CODE of THE SOFTWARE.

MODIFY, MODIFIED, MODIFICATION, MODIFICATIONS
Any change to THE SOFTWARE.

Includes translation of THE SOFTWARE into SOURCE CODE of another type.

Includes any process to produce new SOURCE CODE from THE SOFTWARE via any

LINK, LINKING
The integration, combination, or use of THE SOFTWARE with SYSTEMS by any means.

Includes but is not limited to:
* Function calls regardless of call method ( direct, dynamic, pointers, etc )
* Usage via any API or RPC mechanism
* Invoking as a subprocess
* Any other form of software or hardware interaction that allows
  functionalities to be accessed, used, or modified.

LICENSE Retention and Notification
----------------------------------

Any copied, MODIFIED, redistributed, or PROVIDED SOFTWARE FORM must be
licensed under this same license.

When BINARIES are redistributed, RECIPIENT must:
* Provides notice and reference to THE SOFTWARE that is being licensed
* Inform those they are redistributing to that the BINARY remains under this
  license and may only be used, copied, or redistributed by following the
  license.

Such content must be provided within 90 days of the first usage of a
SOFTWARE FORM for any use beyond testing and development.

________________________________________________________________________________

Prohibition on Circumvention of MODIFICATION PROVISION
------------------------------------------------------

LINKING that accomplishes any these is forbidden:
* Reimplementing or substituting features or functionality of a SOFTWARE FORM
* Altering the internal behavior of a SOFTWARE FORM where it would be more
  sensible to MODIFY THE SOFTWARE.
* "Hooking" or "Injection" of changes into a SOFTWARE FORM

________________________________________________________________________________

Patent Grant
------------

If a patented method or technology is added to, implemented in, or used in
THE SOFTWARE, the CONTRIBUTOR must provide a patent grant. This grant must

clearly identify the patent and the scope of the grant.

The signed patent grant PDF must be included in SOURCE CODE within a directory
named patents. This directory must be accessible to all users who have access
to the THE SOFTWARE that is PROVIDED.

Future License Revision Auto-Adoption
-------------------------------------

This section, starting from "Future License Revision Auto-Adoption" until the
end of the file, may be removed by any CONTRIBUTOR who wishes to. If removed,
the trailing "+" on the version number at the top must be removed.

It is allowed to relicense THE SOFTWARE under the latest version of the
"Fair Coding License" as distributed by Dry Ark LLC, given the following
requirements for that future license revision:

A. The revision remains true to the spirit of the original license.

B. The revision remains focused on preserving the freedom to use, modify, and
distribute THE SOFTWARE, while preventing private modifications.

C. The revision adds no cost requirements to utilizing THE SOFTWARE.
